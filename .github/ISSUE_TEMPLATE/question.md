## ðŸ’¬ Questions and Help

Have a question about exceljs? Need help using it a certain way that our README does not seem to explain? Ask away!

Please keep in mind that we're unpaid open souce volunteers, so it will help us greatly if you add as many details as possible to your question and describe what other approaches you've tried out so far. And of course, we'd love for you to contribute back the answer to our README via a pull request!
